ðŸ”’ Fingerprint-Based Student Attendance System
Tech Stack: PostgreSQL Â· PHP Â· NodeMCU (ESP8266) Â· Arduino Â· HTML/CSS Â· Apache Â· pgAdmin

This project is a biometric attendance system that captures student fingerprints using a fingerprint sensor and records the data in a PostgreSQL database. The system is built around the NodeMCU ESP8266 microcontroller, which communicates the fingerprint data to a local PHP server.
As the database developer, I:

Designed and normalized the PostgreSQL database schema using pgAdmin.

Developed PHP scripts to securely receive, validate, and insert attendance records.

Integrated the ESP8266 module with backend APIs for real-time data logging.

Set up a local server environment using Apache and tested full system flow from fingerprint capture to database entry.

This project showcases full-stack integration of IoT hardware with a structured relational database and custom backend scripting â€” ideal for educational institutions seeking automated attendance tracking.
